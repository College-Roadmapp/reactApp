# About myOSURoadmap

Are you an incoming or current Oregon State student trying to map out your college career? Planning your path to graduation can be a complex process and confusing to navigate. The current method of creating your course roadmap is flawed by issues of accessibility, clarity, and helpfulness. The variety of tools that Oregon State offers are located in multiple different places and it can be difficult to collect all of the necessary information to stay on top of your major. Our goal in creating this application is to relieve students of all these issues and simplify their college planning experience within one place.

Our project, MyOSURoadmap, is a student-built web application that is designed to assist students in easily understanding the course map for their degree. With this tool, users are able to view their required courses spread throughout a four year plan with the ability to customize it to their liking. Students will select their college and major to view a sample of that degree map. After that, courses can easily be moved between terms to view what works best for their schedule and personal preferences. For more information about courses and various programs, a list of links is available to guide users through navigating other helpful student resources.

MyOSURoadmap also works to simplify the complexity around Oregon Stateâ€™s tuition rates and help students plan out their finances. Our web app provides a tuition calculator that estimates the tuition rates for that specific college based on the number of credits being applied. Finally, another supported tool is the progress bar which gives students the ability to track their progress towards earning their degree. By selecting checkboxes next to their completed courses within the roadmap, the progress bar visually displays their finished work.

We hope this project will support students in overcoming these roadblocks and administer an easier experience for planning out their academic career at OSU.

# React Documentation

To create the app, we can the command `npx create-react-app my-app`

## Specific Packages Installed for Our App

`npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`

`npm install --save @ramonak/react-progress-bar`

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
